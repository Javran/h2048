* Package separation. We'd like to keep a core and separate CUI into another package.
* Argument line parsing.
* Support configurations - let's see if we can overengineer this with [dhall](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang)
* Implement some game strategy on top of game core to have fun.
* UI improvement: only show keep for valid moves (or grey-out invalid ones)
